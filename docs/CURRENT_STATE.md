#### Known Issues & TODOs

1. Route Naming Inconsistencies
- [ ] Frontend uses `/dashboard/agent` while backend uses `/api/agents`
- [ ] Frontend uses `/listings` while backend has both `/api/listings` and `/api/properties`
- [ ] Consider consolidating properties/listings endpoints
- [ ] Standardize on either "agent" or "agents" in paths

2. Authentication Gaps
- [ ] Add explicit auth middleware to admin routes
- [ ] Implement consistent auth header checks
- [ ] Add logout endpoint and token invalidation
- [ ] Add token refresh endpoint

3. Missing Routes
- [ ] Add 404 handler in frontend
- [ ] Add health check endpoint (/api/health)
- [ ] Add user profile endpoints
- [ ] Add password reset functionality

4. API Consistency
- [ ] Standardize error response format
- [ ] Add pagination to list endpoints
- [ ] Add filtering capabilities to search endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration

5. Documentation Needs
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Document response formats
- [ ] Add rate limiting information
- [ ] Document error codes and messages

#### Suggested Renames (Pending Approval)
```
Frontend → Backend Alignment:
1. /dashboard/agent → /agent-dashboard
   - Matches API endpoint style
   - Clearer purpose in URL

2. Consolidate Properties/Listings:
   - Keep /api/properties/* for management
   - Use /api/listings/* for public view
   - Update frontend to match this pattern

3. Standardize API Prefix:
   - Ensure all API routes use /api prefix
   - Move admin routes to /api/admin/*
   - Move agent routes to /api/agents/*
```
